## PHEV Power Train Design

- Create MATLAB models for major xEV powertrain components (battery, electric machine, ICE, ...)
- Build full xEV powertrain MATLAB models for simulating design based on performance targets (0-to-60 acceleration, range, energy consumption, GHG emission, ...), powertrain architectures (series, parallel, power-split), well-to-wheels (WTW) life-cycle analysis (LCA), etc.
- Use the MATLAB models to study up-/down-sizing of major components including the battery pack.
- Use the MATLAB models to perform design target optimization studies
