## Distance Measurement and Proximity Indication Application Using Aurix TC375 LK Board


This project aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of multi-core microcontroller architecture and programming by developing an application to measure distance with an ultrasonic sensor and indicate the proximity to an object using LEDs. The hardware platform chosen for this project is the Aurix TC375 board, which features multiple cores that can independently handle different peripherals. GPIOs (General Purpose Input/Output) are used to interface with the ultrasonic sensor and control the LEDs. 

The project will focus on the following key aspects: 

  - Multi-Core Processor Architecture 
  - Ultrasonic Distance Measurement 
  - Proximity Indication 
  - Independent Core Utilization
